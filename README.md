# Drumkit - Project started from https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit

A web application that allows a user to "play the drums" using their keyboard.

Each key in {A, S, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L} corresponds to a sound, and when a user presses a key, the corresponding div will be highlighted.

Used to practice DOM manipulation (Event handling, adding classes to elements, adding new values to a div's style property, etc..) using Javascript.
